    <p>Fast and long range, the Simple Omniwing is a flying wing paper airplane that is--as its name suggests--simple. Although its name may imply it is just another Omniwing variant, in fact it is not and actually has no structural commonality whatsoever. I am very pleased by this airplane because of its excellent performance and original design.

    <p>Fast, long range and simple, the Omniwing is a stealthier variant of the Proto-Omniwing paper airplane. Its balanced design allows it to fly quickly whilst also retaining the ability to fly fairly slow if desired as well; this makes it an excellent trainer. In addition, the design is simple enough to allow further development easily.

    <p>Fast, long range and stealthy, the AeroDelta is an extremely easy to make but capable flying wing paper airplane, meant to complement the older and more complex Omniwing family. The AeroDelta has been specifically designed to not require cutting or measurement with a ruler to maximize simplicity.

    <p>Fast, long range and simple, the OmniStreak is a stealthy flying wing paper airplane developed from the Turbo Omniwing to require less material to construct successfully. Due to this optimization, the OmniStreak is slightly slower than its predecessor, but remains faster than some other variants and can easily serve as an interim aircraft for those transitioning from airplanes like the Skystreak to the Turbo Omniwing and Turbo OmniScimitar.

    <p>Fast, long range and simple, the Turbo OmniScimitar is faster version of the popular Proto-Omniwing paper airplane.
    The design has similar performance to the very similar Turbo Omniwing, but with a lighter airframe--comparable in shape to that of the OmniScimitar.

    <p>Very fast, long range and simple, the Turbo Omniwing is a faster version of the Omniwing, (itself a development of the popular Proto-Omniwing paper airplane), with some structural improvements for high-speed flight.
         The Turbo Omniwing was designed to have performance similar to the UltraDelta, but with a simpler airframe, comparable to that of the OmniScimitar.

    <p>Fast, long range, and stealthy, the OmniScimitar is lightweight variation of the Super Omniwing capable of flying like few other flying wings can.
    When the Super Omniwing was published almost two years ago, it was the latest, most advanced Omniwing variant.
    The next Omniwing variation, the Manta, would not come for another year, and it was dissimilar from previous Omniwing developments.
    I decided to design a new Omniwing to complement the Super Omniwing, which had become among my most popular airplanes.

    <p>Very fast, long range and stealthy, the UltraDelta is likely my most advanced flying wing paper airplane to date. This airplane was designed to replace the Super OmniDelta and appease viewer's wishes for new delta wing paper airplane too. I am quite proud of this paper airplane, because it is not a development of any existing model and its characteristics are so excellent. I am sure it will please others just as much.

    <p>Fast, long range, and stable, the Strike OmniDelta is a flying wing that uses the experience gathered from its predecessors and brings their strengths in, under a common airframe.
    Evolving from the original OmniDelta and Super OmniDelta paper airplanes, the Strike OmniDelta uses a similar fin arrangement to the former, and a weight distribution similar to the latter.
    As a result, the Strike OmniDelta is faster than the former and more stable than the latter.

    <p>Very fast, long range and stealthy, the Omniwing Swift is a flying wing paper airplane derived from the larger Omniwing Zeta.
The concept of the Omniwing Swift preceded the Omniwing Zeta, despite the latter's ultimately earlier publication.
The Swift was originally intended to serve as a half-scale testbed for the Zeta's design, exploring the viability of whether or not the design would work. Ultimately, the Swift was not built before the Zeta was proceeded with because I elected to proceed with full scale work on the Zeta immediately.

   <p>The Omniwing Zeta (or simply The Zeta project) is a refined variant of the popular Advanced Omniwing flying wing paper airplane by menamiketrx of YouTube, meant to be fast, long range and stealthy.
    While the Zeta does retain a good portion of its predecessor's features, it also integrates new building techniques that enable easier construction and better performance.
